# Tzetzes: MP News Search

Tzetzes is a Rails-based full stack application that:
- Displays an aggregated list of MPs' articles, press releases and local news publications against the correct MP.
- Allows users to search through articles and their headlines for keyword(s).

Whilst sounding quite dry (!), this is a radical step forward in terms of quick and easy searching of publications by elected officials that have not previously been catalogued.

##Â Quickstart
First, clone this repository. Then:

Databases
```bash
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew services start postgresql
$ psql postgres
```

```bash
$ bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed # This will add in MPs and one test article.
$ rails s #Start the server at localhost:3000
```

In order to add more articles, you have to post to the database using a scraper tool. This script is proprietary, but may be open-sourced in the future.

## Running Tests
From the root folder, run the following command:
```bash
$ rspec 
```

## Running Tzetzes
From the root folder, run the following command:
